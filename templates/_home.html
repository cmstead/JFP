<h2>A different kind of functional library...</h2>

<p>
    The Javascript Function Processor (JFP) is a different kind of functional library.  Like Lodash and Underscore,
    JFP provides common functions like map, filter, partial, compose and so on.  Unlike Lodash and Underscore,
    JFP is designed around the idea that functions are going to be used more like one would program in
    Lisp, Haskell or other functional languages.
