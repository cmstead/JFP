JFP - Javascript Function Processor
===================================

Library documentation:

http://cmstead.github.io/JFP

Javascript Function Processor is a functional library built around the idea that functional
programming shouldn't require special objects or OO paradigms to play well. Chaining shouldn't
be limited to functions in the library.

Programmers should be able to extend their libraries easily. Programmers should be able
to bend their environment to their own will, not the other way around. This is what JFP gives you.
