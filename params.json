Chaining shouldn't\r\nbe limited to functions in the library.\r\n\r\nProgrammers should be able to extend their libraries easily. Programmers should be able\r\nto bend their environment to their own will, not the other way around. This is what JFP gives you.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
